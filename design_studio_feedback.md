 Issues raised by peers? How Will you address these?

 One of the primary issues that our peers raised was the means by which we would be encoding data on our cartogram. With so many different types of energy, how exactly would be go about cleaning up the enregy such that only the most relevant was being shown as opposed to information that may be repetetive in its scope. WE would essentially address this, by manualy cleaning the data to only select for the enrgy types and various metrics for energy usage based on what is most primary in current news (Nuclear, coal, fuel, alternative, hydroelectric, etc.). A second issue was that of animation with respect to the narrative of the visualization. The issue proposed was that it would not be immediately clear what the user was looking at. In this sense we would implement a tutorial feature taking the users hand and showing them piece by piece what is going on and how to interact with our visualization. Additionally, with the time scale, we would be implementing a start and stop button to allow for the user to sit back and see dynamically how the data is being changed on the cartogram. The feedback we received was very helpful in the respect that it further helped us to figure out which components of our visualization should be shifted from optional to must-have and vice versa. We figured that the cartogram with the customized force feature would be the most interesting thing if implemneted, and decided to make this the core of our visualzation.
